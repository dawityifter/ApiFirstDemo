    "description": "BillGO's Funding API specifies the contract BillGO's partners must implement in order to provide authorization to proceed with a user's bill payment. BillGO is the client of this API and will make a request to the partner's implementation to reserve funds to cover a payment or reimburse funds for a returned payment.\n\n**The Funding API service *must* be idempotent.** If the service receives duplicate requests (such as two requests to authorize a debit of the same amount for the same PaymentID), the service must return the same response to both requests. When duplicate funding requests are received, the partner should _not_ reserve funds from the customer account twice. The API should simply return the `debitAuthTransactionId` and `status` values that were returned in the response to the original request. This ensures that debit authorizations interrupted in-flight can be retried successfully and minimizes the need for BillGO Payment Operations to contact the partner's support team.\n\n## Retries\nAPI invocation failures are handled by BillGO in two different manners. Re-tryable failures will be retried by BillGO with increasing back-off. When retries are exhausted or a non-retryable failure occurs (such as an HTTP `400` responses), the BillGO Payment Operations team will investigate the failure and may reach out to the partner's support team. In addition to HTTP status codes documented for individual endpoints below, BillGO will always retry errors that suggest transient infrastructure issues including:\n * `401` Unauthorized\n * `403` Not Allowed\n * `404` Not Found\n * `429` Too Many Requests\n * `503` Service Unavailable\n\nRepeated failures for retryable errors will cause the BillGO Payment Operations team to contact the partner's support team.\n",

This API endpoint will be invoked when a payee returns funds for a previously-completed payment.\n\nGeneration of payment returns is at the discretion of the payee. A payee may return the original amount of the payment, an amount smaller than the original payment, or an amount larger than the original payment. A payee may generate multiple returns against a single payment. BillGO partners must be capable of supporting all of these return scenarios and crediting the original payer appropriately.\n\nIt is recommended that partners treat multiple credits for the same original payment and the same return amount on the same calendar date as duplicate requests. When a duplicate credit authorization is detected, the partner implementation should return the same response as was returned to the original request *without* crediting the users account a second time. This  ensures that credit authorization requests interrupted in-flight (e.g. due to a network interruption) can be successfully re-processed without requiring manual intervention. In cases where credit authorizations fail repeatedly, BillGO Payment Operations will contact the partner's support team.",
